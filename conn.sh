Connemara Ponies are around 128-148 cm tall.
They take their name from a rocky and isolated part of West Ireland.
One hypothesis of their origin is that the Vikings brought them in 795 AD.
These ponies were first used by local farmers and labourers to bring large baskets of rock, and seaweed from the shore, to act as fertiliser.
The Connemara Pony Breeders Society was created in 1923, with the English Connemara Society being established in 1947.
Perhaps one of the best known of this breed is Stroller, who was ridden by Marion Mould, an English show-jumper born in 1947.
The most magnificent performance of Connemara ponies takes place at the Clifden Show in County Galway on the third Thursday of every August.
The principal use of the Connemara pony today is as a sports pony.
